## UnityGameDevAcademy
A compilation of projects for a course in C# and Unity 3d. 

## Zombie Roll
The very first game of the course, they definitely come out swinging. This game was really fun to make, and I think there's more that can be done. Like obstacles. Oooooh obstacles. 

## Haunted Zombie Rush
This is a little flappy bird type game using a zombie instead of a bird. The biggest challenge for me was getting the rocks to rotate while moving forward, because the rotation after a long period of time would actually move the rocks further and further from the platform. I think the fix for this was to use the right Vector 3.

## Tower Defense
A simple tower defense game in 2D. The review of the course was right, it does seem kind of hacky. I'll definitely finish this course before coming back and looking at some of the code. I think that I would be able to do a much better job planning and executing a tower defense game.
