## Overview
This is a small tower defense game built from a Unity tutorial. The goal is to kill all of the enemies (skeletons) by shooting projectiles from towers (buildings). These buildings also can only be built on certain spots. From the get go, this was kind of a crappy tutorial. I don't think I learned much from it, though practicing typing was pretty cool. Instead of going through to the next section, I've decided to focus on learning algorithms instead. 

## Singletons
I made a singleton in this game, though I'm not sure if I know exactly what that means. If I'm wrong, I'll edit this comment out, but from the tutorial it seems that a singleton is used so that there can only be one instance of a script running in the game at all times. These include (in this game) GameManager, TowerManager, and SoundManager.
